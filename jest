npm is just like playstore of apps -> just like in playstore we have access to various applications that are created by some other developers -> similarly npm gives us packages or code that is written by other developers
in other words npm is defined as a tool that manages and install all the dependencies that is required in out application

package.json gives us an overview of what this application is all about -> just like an index of a book
In package.json --> "main" represents the entry point to our application

npm is open source but it does not means that it is free for production also.. depending upon the licence we have to pay to the author for his copyrights

package-lock.json --> in package-lock.json all the version of dependencies are declared which are present in node modules-> so the package-lock.json ensures that after cloning the repo user when user tries to install any dependency then system will check if that depency is present in package-lock ? install only that particular version : install latest version

steps
1.npm init
2.npm install --save-dev jest
3.write code in index and index.test.js
4.replace "test":"jest" in package.json
5.npm run test

<!-- there are packages that are only imp for the developer then install it in developer dependencies using this flag  --save-dev -->
<!-- there are packages that are imp for both the developer and the end user then install it in dependencies -->

<!-- to run any specific file -> npm run test __tests__/test.js -->

NOTE --> Shallow equal only checks values which are one level depper into the object but if there is an object inside an object then it cant compare and will return false

Deep equal checks values upto the root level
